   ‚úÖ Primary query analysis  
   ‚úÖ Competition assessment  
   ‚úÖ Intent categorization (informational / educational / navigational / transactional / commercial)

2. **Identify Central Entity**  
   ‚úÖ What is the main subject/concept?  
   ‚úÖ Extract from: query + top organic results + PAA patterns  
   ‚úÖ Validate: does it appear consistently across all data points?  

3. **Map Secondary Entities & Attributes**  
   ‚úÖ List related concepts from organic results  
   ‚úÖ Extract attributes from PAA questions

4. AI OVERVIEW VERIFICATION PROCEDURE

### MANDATORY CHECK BEFORE ANALYSIS
1. **Check the location of AI Overview in JSON:**

‚úÖ **CORRECT:** snippets_data.ai_overview.content

‚ùå **NOT AI OVERVIEW:** people_also_ask.questions[X].ai_overview
2. **Verify presence:**
   * Does snippets_found contain "ai_overview"?
   * Does snippets_data.ai_overview exist?
3. **Report precisely:**

‚ùå **WRONG:** ‚ÄúAI Overview active‚Äù

‚úÖ **CORRECT:** ‚ÄúAI answers in PAA, no standalone AI Overview‚Äù

### STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

**Status** **Optimization Priority**
- Standalone AI Overview: Citation-friendly content
- Only PAA AI answers: Question-based optimization
- No AI features: AI readiness preparation

### QUICK CHECK

üëâ *Is this a standalone AI Overview at the top of the SERP, or only AI-enhanced PAA answers?*

**Output:** Entity Map + Intent Classification

3. **Competitive Landscape Assessment**  
   ‚úÖ Analyze top 3 organic results  
   ‚úÖ Identify content gaps  
   ‚úÖ Check for AI Overview presence/competition  

**Decision Checkpoint:**  
* **HIGH COMPETITION + AI OVERVIEW PRESENT** ‚Üí Focus on citations vs rankings  
* **STRONG USER CONCERNS VISIBLE** ‚Üí Authority building priority  
* **MULTIPLE INTENT TYPES** ‚Üí Content cluster vs single article  

**Output:** Intent Map + Competitive Analysis + Content Gaps

   ‚úÖ Trust signals to incorporate

   ‚úÖ Outer section (supporting topics) mapping  
   ‚úÖ Internal linking strategy design  

**Output:** Business-Aligned Content Strategy  

### PHASE 4: CONTENT STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT
**Tasks:**
1. **Article Topic Generation**  
   ‚úÖ Primary article (highest volume/impact)  
   ‚úÖ Supporting articles (authority building)  
   ‚úÖ Long-tail capture articles

   ‚úÖ Topic clusters around central entity  
   ‚úÖ Internal linking architecture  
   ‚úÖ Content depth vs breadth balance
